        <h1>Scrotch eggs are a tasty and different way to prepare eggs!</h1>
        <p>So what are scrotch eggs?</p>
        <p>A Scotch egg is a soft-boiled egg that has been wrapped in pork sausage, breaded, and deep-fried or baked. Despite its name, this likely has English (not Scottish) origins.</p>
        <p>Scotch eggs are commonly served cold at picnics in the U.K. and packaged Scotch eggs are widely available in British supermarkets, corner shops, and gas stations.</p>
